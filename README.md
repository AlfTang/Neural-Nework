Neural-Nework
=============

This repo is the programming Exercise 3 & 4 about neural network in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.  
Ex3 is a neural network to recognise hand-written digits by one-vs-all logistic regression.  
Ex4 is a neural network to recognise hand-written digits by backpropagation algorithm.  
The course info can be found here https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class/index.  
The details of this assignment is described in ex3.pdf and ex4.pdf

The codes are written by Octave.  
For further info of Octave please see http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

In this assignment set, a small neural network with logistic regression for recognising hand-written digits will be created.  
This set include the following functions:  

ex3.m - Octave script that will help step you through part 1  
ex3 nn.m - Octave script that will help step you through part 2  
ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits  
ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise  
ex4.m - Octave script that will help check the result of exercise  
ex4data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits  
ex4weights.mat - Neural network parameters for exercise 4  
displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset  
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)  
sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function  
lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function  
oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier  
predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier  
computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients  
checkNNGradients.m - Function to help check gradients  
debugInitializeWeights.m - Function for initializing weights
